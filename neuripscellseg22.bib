  abstract =   {Cell instance segmentation, which identifies each specific cell area within a mi- croscope image, is helpful for cell analysis. Because of the high computational cost brought on by the large number of objects in the scene, mainstream instance segmentation techniques require much time and computational resources. In this paper, we proposed a two-stage method in which the first stage detects the bounding boxes of cells, and the second stage is segmentation in the detected bounding boxes. This method reduces inference time by more than 30\% on images that image size is larger than 1024 pixels by 1024 pixels compared to the mainstream instance segmentation method while maintaining reasonable accuracy without using any external data.}

  abstract =   {Cell Segmentation is an initial and fundamental step in biomedical image analysis, which strongly affects the experimental results of this analysis. Recently, deep learning based segmentation methods have shown great power in segmentation accuracy and efficiency. However, these data-driven methods still face many challenges, such as lack of annotations, multi-modality, and complex morphology, where morphological complexity significantly limits model performance. In this paper, we propose a new all-purpose framework with high morphological adaptability for multi-modality cell segmentation, termed Cell Segmenter (CS). For high convex cells with an arbitrary size, the Anchor-based Watershed Framework (AWF) precisely locates well-defined cell centers and generates segmentation based on these markers. For those elongated or non-convex cells, the center-independent segmentation method Omnipose is adopted to obtain satisfying masks. In the inference time, confidence-based quality estimation is conducted on the branch predictions if needed, and then the better result is chosen as the final segmentation. The F1-score of the proposed method reaches 0.8537 on TuningSet and 0.6216 on the final test set of the NeurIPS 2022 Cell Segmentation Challenge.}

Classical tools for biological image segmentation need to be adjusted to the cell type and image conditions to get decent results. Another limitation is the lack of high-quality labeled data to train alternative methods like Deep Learning since manual labeling is costly and time-consuming. <em> Weakly Supervised Cell Segmentation in Multi-modality High-Resolution Microscopy Images </em> was organized by NeurIPS to solve this problem. The aim of the challenge was to develop a versatile method that can work with high variability, with few labeled images, a lot of unlabeled images, and with no human interaction. We developed CrossCT, a framework based on the cross--teaching between a CNN and a Transformer. The main idea behind this work was to improve the organizers' baseline methods and use both labeled and unlabeled data. Experiments show that our method outperforms the baseline methods based on a supervised learning approach. We achieved an F1 score of 0.5988 for the Transformer and 0.5626 for the CNN respecting the time limits imposed for inference.}

  abstract =  {Deep learning has achieved significant improvement in cell segmentation of microscopy images in the field of Biology. However, a lack of generalization has been a major bottleneck of segmentation models since the performance is largely degraded with out-of-distribution data or unseen class data. Developing a generalized segmentation model is challenging due to the diversity of modalities, different staining methods, complicated cell shapes, and extremely high image resolution in microscopy images. The dataset for the ‘’Weakly Supervised Cell Segmentation in Multi-modality High-Resolution Microscopy Images'' challenge consists of images with these diverse characteristics. To address these challenges, we trained the Cellpose model to competently perform instance segmentation on datasets with various characteristics. For that, we 1) specified the model to only use green and blue channels for all types of cell images, and 2) investigated the effect and performance of the existing diameter estimation model to determine the areas where it performs best, using images of various resolutions. As a result, we achieved an F1 score of 0.7607 for the validation (Tuning) set.}

  abstract =   {Automatic cell segmentation enjoys great popularity with the development of deep learning. However, existing methods tend to focus on the binary segmentation between foreground and background in a single domain, but fail to generalize to multi-modality cell images and to exploit numerous valuable unlabeled data. To mitigate these limitations, we propose a Modality-aware Anti-ambiguity UNet (MAUNet) in a unified deep model via an encoder-decoder structure for robust cell segmentation. The proposed MAUNet model enjoys several merits. First, the proposed instance-aware decode endows pixel features with better cell boundary discrimination capabilities benefiting from cell-wise distance field. And the ambiguity-aware decode aims at alleviating the domain gap caused by multimodality cell images credited to a customized anti-ambiguity proxy for domaininvariant learning. Second, we prepend the consistency regularization to enable exploration of unlabeled images, and a novel post-processing strategy to incorporate morphology prior to cell instance segmentation. Experimental results on the official validation set demonstrate the effectiveness of our method. }

Afterward, we train a separate segmentation model for each category using the images in the corresponding category. Besides, we further deploy two types of segmentation models to segment cells with roundish and irregular shapes respectively.

Currently, the rapid development of deep learning realizes the automation of cell segmentation, which significantly decreases the workload of clinicians and researchers. However, most existing cell segmentation frameworks are fully supervised and modality-specific. Towards this end, this paper proposes a semi-supervised cell instance segmentation framework for multi-modality microscope images. Firstly, $K$-Means clustering is utilized to discriminate the image modality. Then, for phase contrast and differential interference contrast images, Cellpose is adopted. For brightfield images, we subdivide them into two sub-categories according to the cell diameter by $K$-Means and optimize a U-Net for the large diameter group. For fluorescence images, we propose a semi-supervised learning strategy using CDNet. The leaderboard shows that our proposed framework reaches an F1 score of 0.8428 on the tuning set, which ranks 6th among all teams.}

Recently, image segmentation methods based on supervised learning have achieved promising results. However, most of them rely on intensive manual annotations, which are extremely time-consuming and expensive for cell segmentation. In addition, existing methods are often trained for a specific modality with poor generalization ability. In this paper, a novel semi-supervised cell segmentation method is proposed to segment microscopy images from multiple modalities. Specifically, Mean Teacher model is introduced to a multi-task learning framework, named Multi-task Mean Teacher (MT$^{2}$), in which both the classification and the regression heads are utilized to improve the prediction performance. Moreover, new data augmentation and multi-scale inference strategies are presented to enhance the robustness and generalization ability. For the quantitative evaluation on the Tuning Set of NeurIPS 2022 Cell Segmentation Competition, our method achieves the F1 Score of 0.8690, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed semi-supervised learning method.
